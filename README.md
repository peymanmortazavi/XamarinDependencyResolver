Xamarin Dependency Resolvers for Mac

This is just to make things easier when setting up a CI server.

If this is on Mac, simply move the entire thing in the */bin/* or your preferred directory. If you wish to put it in any place other than */bin/*, you will need to modify **nuget** and **xamarinresolve**

move files using the following command when inside the root directory.

sudo cp * /bin/
